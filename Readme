According to Bayes Theorem
P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A)
P(B)
Applying the same to find probability of a coin flipped is fair given tail
P(F|T)= P(T|F)* P(F)/P(T|F)P(F) + P(T|B) P(B)
P(F|T) = probability of a coin flipped is fair given tail.
P(T|F) = probability that tail will occur given coin is fair
P(F) = probability that fair coin is picked.
P(T|B) = = probability that tail will occur given coin is bias
P(B) = probability that bias coin is picked
Given:
P(T|F) = 0.5
P(F)= 0.5
P(T|B)=0.75
P(B)=0.25
P(F|T) = 0.5 *0.5 = 0.4
(0.5*0.5)+(0.75*0.5)
Probability that the randomly picked coin is fair that flip produced a tail is = 0.4 = 40%

By Bayes Theorem we can derive the same for P(F|TT) as shown below
P(F|TT)= P(TT|F)*P(F)/P(TT)
P(F|TT)= P(T,T|F)*P(F)/P(T|T)P(F|T)+P(T|T)P(B|T)
Probability of getting two tails flips for a fair coin is 0.5*0.5 = 0.25
0.25*0.5 = 0.30769= 30.769%
(0.25*0.5)+((0.75*0.75)*0.5)
Probability that the randomly picked coin is fair that when flipped twice produced tail is 0.3.76 or 30%
