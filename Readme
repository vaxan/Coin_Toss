Finding out if a coin is biased or not.
You have a large jar containing many coins. Half of the coins are fair (denoted F) and 
the other half are biased towards tail (denoted B). With a biased coin, you would flip a tail in 3 out of 4 cases.


probability that a randomly picked coin is fair given that the first flip produced a tail
According to Bayes Theorem
P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A)
P(B)
Applying the same to find probability of a coin flipped is fair given tail
P(F|T)= P(T|F)* P(F)/P(T|F)P(F) + P(T|B) P(B)
P(F|T) = probability of a coin flipped is fair given tail.
P(T|F) = probability that tail will occur given coin is fair
P(F) = probability that fair coin is picked.
P(T|B) = = probability that tail will occur given coin is bias
P(B) = probability that bias coin is picked
Given:
P(T|F) = 0.5
P(F)= 0.5
P(T|B)=0.75
P(B)=0.25
P(F|T) = 0.5 *0.5 = 0.4
(0.5*0.5)+(0.75*0.5)
Probability that the randomly picked coin is fair that flip produced a tail is = 0.4 = 40%

the probability of the coin to be fair is now when we fipped tail two times
By Bayes Theorem we can derive the same for P(F|TT) as shown below
P(F|TT)= P(TT|F)*P(F)/P(TT)
P(F|TT)= P(T,T|F)*P(F)/P(T|T)P(F|T)+P(T|T)P(B|T)
Probability of getting two tails flips for a fair coin is 0.5*0.5 = 0.25
0.25*0.5 = 0.30769= 30.769%
(0.25*0.5)+((0.75*0.75)*0.5)
Probability that the randomly picked coin is fair that when flipped twice produced tail is 0.3.76 or 30%


Python program checks for each coin flip, coin being biased using the same principles as Bayes theorem it will calculate the posterior based on likelihood, prior and evidence provided.
Initially prior will be the chances of picking a bias coin from a jug is always 0.5 as it also contains fair coins.
Likelihood of head coming up for a biased coin is taken as 0.25 as given in task 1
Likelihood of tail coming up for a biased coin is taken as 0.75 as given in task1
Applying these we can calculate the evidence.
Once posterior is calculated, prior will be updated with the posterior which was calculated before for every coin flip.
According to graph we can see that the probability of the coin when flipped is more towards fair coin than bias coin after 12 experiments.
